												<h4>MondoDB Hands-On</h4>
												<p>I'm not very proud of this one. I usually do these projects with open-source tools for my post-graduation assignments. This assignment was not a project per se, but rather a step-by-step activity that I had to finish. Anyway, at least I can say that I know MongoDB. </p>

												<h4>Brazilian public dataset using Apache Cassandra</h4>
												<p>I found a very interesing dataset, the Portal da Trasparência (Transparency Portal). I learned a lot about API calls and more advance data cleaning using Spark. Of course, I learned a lot of Cassandra too.</p>

												<h4>Bike company dataset using Spark</h4>
												<p>Yeah, I know it's getting repetitive, I have to find another great dataset for my labs. But at least I learned more Spark! I even grasped some machine learning in this one! It's very rudimentary, but you get the point.</p>

												<h4>Bike company dataset using Hadoop</h4>
												<p>Apache Hadoop might be the most iconic tool used in Data Egineering to this date, if we could define a tool that would define big data, it would be it. Very interesting to use Hive on top of the MapReduce concept, it proves to be a very efficient way to analyse large amounts of data.</p>

												<h4>Rox Challenge</h4>
												<p>This is a challenge I have made for the role of Data Engineer. I had to clean and upload six .csv files to a database in the cloud, make some data analysis and some visualizations. Of course I used AWS, I also made and ERD to make my schema creation easier, used Lambda for the ETL process, Pandas for EDA and data cleaning and QuickSight for the data visualizations. Of course there is more so do checkout the project.</p>
